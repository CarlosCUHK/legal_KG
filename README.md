# legal_KG

law_extraction.py is used to divide the law chapter into segments. Two files will be produced by running law_extraction.py (json file and xlsx file). xlsx file can better visualise how we seperate the legal document while the json file is easier for reading and further processing. Please note that the input file to law_extraction.py is the legal document chapter in html format (You can directly download from web page).

KG_construction.py is used to build the knowledge graph base on the given legal document and QA pair. Remember to download neo4j and open the database before running the program. The program can directly import the legal document nodes from the json file generated by law_extraction.py. 

After git clone this repo, you can directly run below code to generate KG for employment ordinance:
```
python KG_construction.py --file_format json --filepath 57ç« .json --clear_KG true
```
```
python KG_construction.py
```

The visualised result will be like the following:
